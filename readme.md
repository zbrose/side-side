# Unit 2 Project - Swap

Swap is a music database that a user can get information on recordings by artist, record title, or song title. Users may view an albums information such as credits and track listing, as well as openly comment and rate their experience with the music.  Users are also able to book mark records to return to on streaming applications or otherwise.
